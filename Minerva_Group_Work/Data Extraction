Using the Container
Dockerfile: Contains the instructions for building the Docker image.

docker-compose.yml: Defines the services and configuration for running the container.

src/main.py: The main Python script that reads miniSEED files and processes them.

nginx/nginx.conf: Configuration file for the Nginx server.

data/: Directory where you'll place your miniSEED files.

.gitignore: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore.

README.md: Project documentation.

This structure provides a streamlined environment for reading miniSEED files with ObsPy, processing them with Dask, and serving the results through Nginx. The container will:

Read miniSEED files from the /app/data/ directory
Process the data using ObsPy and Dask
Save the processed data as a CSV file in the /app/data/ directory
Serve the CSV file through Nginx
To use this setup:

Place your miniSEED files in the data/ directory.
Run docker-compose up --build to start the container.
The container will read the miniSEED file, convert it to a CSV, and save it in the /app/data/ directory.
You can access the CSV file through the Nginx server at http://localhost/processed_data.csv.
