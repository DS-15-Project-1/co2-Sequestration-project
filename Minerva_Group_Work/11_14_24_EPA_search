### search method:
To look at CO₂ injection-related data for Kansas from January through June 2021 on the CAMPD EPA website, follow these steps:

1. **Visit the Website**: Go to [CAMPD's custom data download page](https://campd.epa.gov/data/custom-data-download).

2. **Select the Data Type**: **Emissions - Hourly** or **Emissions - Continuous Monitoring** based on the granularity of data. If available, options directly related to CO₂.

3. **Select the Date Range**: **Start Date** to `01/01/2021` and the **End Date** to `06/30/2021`.

4. **Filter by State**: **Kansas**

5. **Program Selection**:
Based CO₂ injections, emissions tracking.
The most relevant programs could be:
New Source Performance Standards subpart TTTT (NSPS4T) – If it covers CO₂-related standards for injection or capture.
Acid Rain Program (ARP) – May indirectly track CO₂ data.
Cross-State Air Pollution Rule NOx Annual Program (CSNOX) – If NOx data is tied to CO₂ injection sites.
Skip ozone-focused or regional programs like RGGI unless specific to CO₂.

6. **Unit Fuel Type Selection**
For CO₂ injection, typical sources may include:
Natural Gas (NNG) or Pipeline Natural Gas (PNG) – Common for CO₂ emissions or capture facilities.
Coal (C) – If coal plants are part of the CO₂ capture.
Other Solid Fuel (OSF) or Process Gas (PRG) – If applicable to specific industrial CO₂ capture and storage.


If there isnt a direct "CO₂ injection" category, look for relevant facilities or sources associated with injection activities, such as wells or specific facilities listed under Kansas' stationary sources for CO₂ emissions.

7. review the fields. Look for: CO₂ injection-specific fields (e.g., monitored storage, emissions related to injection). Facilities identified as injection or storage sites.

8. **Run the Query**: click **Submit** or **Download Data**.

The logic behind selecting **Programs** and **Fuel Types** lies in identifying the connection between **CO₂ emissions**, **capture**, and **injection processes**, as these are commonly associated with specific regulatory programs and fuel sources. Here’s the reasoning:

---

### Reasoning for Program & Fuel selection
Selecting programs and fuels tied to **large emitters** and **carbon capture technologies** can narrow the dataset to facilities or sources relevant to **CO₂ injection**. This ensures my search aligns with industries and programs that monitor or participate in carbon management initiatives.


### **Programs**
1. **New Source Performance Standards subpart TTTT (NSPS4T)**:
- **Why**: This program governs emissions from specific facilities, including CO₂ emissions from power plants. Facilities with carbon capture and storage (CCS) may fall under this program.
- **Relevance**: Likely includes data for facilities engaged in CO₂ capture, injection, or monitoring as part of emissions reductions.

2. **Acid Rain Program (ARP)**:
- **Why**: While primarily focused on SO₂ and NOx reductions, the program covers large emitters, many of which may also monitor CO₂ as part of their operations.
- **Relevance**: May provide indirect insight into facilities likely involved in CO₂ injection.

3. **Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) Programs (e.g., CSNOX)**:
- **Why**: These programs track pollutants like NOx and SO₂, often from facilities that also monitor or capture CO₂ due to regulatory overlaps.
- **Relevance**: Emission sources participating in CSAPR may also engage in CCS or CO₂ injection activities.

4. **Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)** (less likely for Kansas):
- **Why**: Tracks greenhouse gas emissions, including CO₂, in participating states. However, Kansas is not part of RGGI, so this is likely irrelevant.

### **Fuel Types**
1. **Natural Gas (NNG, PNG)**:
- *Why**: Facilities using natural gas are common candidates for carbon capture technologies due to their lower baseline CO₂ emissions and higher efficiency.
- **Relevance**: Likely contributors to CO₂ injections if CCS is implemented.

2. **Coal (C)**:
- **Why**: Coal-fired power plants are significant CO₂ emitters and are often equipped with CCS technology to mitigate emissions.
- **Relevance**: High likelihood of being involved in CO₂ injection efforts.

3. **Process Gas (PRG)** or **Other Gas (OGS)**:
- **Why**: Industrial processes that produce CO₂ as a byproduct may inject it for storage or use it for enhanced oil recovery (EOR).
- **Relevance**: Direct link to CO₂ injections depending on the industry.

4. **Other Solid Fuel (OSF)**:
- **Why**: Includes alternative fuels that might be associated with CO₂ production.
- **Relevance**: Less likely but worth including if the specific facilities in Kansas use solid fuel.

---

### **Exclusions**
- **Ozone Programs** (e.g., CSOSG1, CSOSG2):
- Focused on NOx and ozone pollution during summer months; not directly related to CO₂.
- **Fuel Types like Wood, Tires, and Refuse**:
- Unlikely to be linked to significant CO₂ injection or storage activities.
